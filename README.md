# Mu2e_NRET
Muon to electron conversion -  non-relativistic effective theory.

This repository contains Python and Mathematica implementations of a nonrelativistic effective theory
(NRET) appropriate for analyzing nuclear experiments.   There are two versions.   The first release,
described in [1]

This is an example reference <sup>[WCHForm]</sup>.
