Element:  "Ca"        # Can use UI element spelling Sulfur or it's symbol S (also Britsh sp)
# Isotope:  0         # 0 says to average
Isotope:  40          # 40 picks a specific Isotope of Ca
Interaction: kbp      # bw is short for "Brown-Wildenthal", which also works
oscb:     0           # in fm. Omit or set to 0 to calc from average A (Abar) over isotopes
